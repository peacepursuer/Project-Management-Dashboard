This power BI dasboards help to track project progress effectively by using Gantt charts to visualize the project timeline, and budget insights for the financial performance and the project details to know the full information on each project, 
and I wrote series of DAX measures for all the calculations.
This 3 dashboards are bookmarked into one page and connected with a navigator to access each page. 
The project Timeline page has the Gnart chat holding the Project Progress Bar showing the Task Status. 
The Project Details page has 3 cards showing the Tasks In Progress, Tasks Not Started and The Completed Tasks. 
It also has 2 other cards showing the Total Monthly Tasks and the Completed Tasks placed on top of a Line and Stacked Column Chart to show the monthly details of project. 
There is also a Stacked Column Chart holding the Total Tasks by Project Name and Task Status which help to show the number of Blocked, Completed, In Progress and Not Started projects. 
The last visual on this page is the Decomposition Tree showing the Total Tasks by the Project Name, The Priority Level and the Task Status. 
The Budget page has a cards for the Total Budget, Amount Spent and Balance then Gauge for the % of the Budget Utilized and another card for the % of the remaining budget. 
We also have 2 Clustered Bar Charts for Budget vs Amount Spent by Project Name and the remaining balance for each project and 2 other Clustered Bar Charts for Budget vs Amount Spent by Tasks and the remaining balance for each task. 
We also have a line chart showing trends of the Budget vs Amount Spent on monthly basis and also an Area chart showing the monthly Cumulative Budget and the Cumulative Amount Spent.
All the visuals are sliced by the Project Manager and Date and the visuals are formatted conditionally using Dax codes.
